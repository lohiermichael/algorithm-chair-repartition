    "1. Use `numpy` library to navigate through the 2D-arrays more efficiently. For instance there is no need to build the object `row` or `col` as I do.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. I explore the **checkpoints** in function of the stack that has been built all along. What if I tried with a queue of checkpoints instead? It would explore the checkpoints closer to the initial position of the chair first. I tested it on a few examples before and the stack was more performant than the queue overall. Indeed, moving horizontally and scanning all the columns or moving vertically and scanning all the rows, makes the exploration in a close area around the initial point pretty thorough. Thus, it makes sense, to explore as far as possible first. However, there are a few cases where stacking the checkpoints will make a chair move far away whereas its room name is really close.\n",
